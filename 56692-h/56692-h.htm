</div>
<p>I will begin by saying that Editha was always
rather a queer little girl, and not much like
other children. She was not a strong, healthy
little girl, and had never been able to run about and
play; and, as she had no sisters or brothers, or companions
of her own size, she was rather old-fashioned,
as her aunts used to call it. She had always
been very fond of books, and had learned to read
when she was such a tiny child, that I should almost
be afraid to say how tiny she was when she read her
first volume through. Her papa wrote books himself,
and was also the editor of a newspaper; and,
as he had a large library, Editha perhaps read more
than was quite good for her. She lived in London;
and, as her mamma was very young and pretty, and
went out a great deal, and her papa was so busy, and
her governess only came in the morning, she was
left to herself a good many hours in the day, and
when she was left to herself, she spent the greater
part of her time in the library reading her papa&rsquo;s
big books, and even his newspapers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>She was very fond of the newspapers, because
she found so many curious things in them,&mdash;stories,
for instance, of strange events which happened
every day in the great city of London, and yet
never seemed to happen anywhere near where she
lived. Through the newspapers, she found that there
were actually men who lived by breaking into peoples&rsquo;
houses and stealing all the nice things they could
carry away, and she read that such men were called
burglars. When she first began to read about
burglars, she was very much troubled. In the first
place, she felt rather timid about going to bed at
night, and, in the second place, she felt rather sorry
for the burglars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose no one ever taught them any better,&rdquo;
she thought.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p013.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="712" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">She spent most of her time in the library reading her papa&rsquo;s big books</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>In fact, she thought so much about the matter,
that she could not help asking her papa some questions
one morning when he was at breakfast. He
was reading his paper and eating his chops both at
once when she spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she said, in a solemn little voice, and
looking at him in a very solemn manner, &ldquo;papa
dear, what do you think of burglars&mdash;as a class?&rdquo;
(She said &ldquo;as a class,&rdquo; because she had heard one
of her papa&rsquo;s friends say it, and as he was a gentleman
she admired very much, she liked to talk as he
did.) Her papa gave a little jump in his chair, as if
she had startled him, and then he pushed his hair
off his forehead and stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burglars! As a class!&rdquo; he said, and then he
stared at her a minute again in rather a puzzled
way. &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As a class,
Nixie!&rdquo; (that was his queer pet name for her.)
&ldquo;Nixie, where is your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in bed, papa dear, and we mustn&rsquo;t disturb
her,&rdquo; said Editha. &ldquo;The party last night tired
her out. I peeped into her room softly as I came
down. She looks so pretty when she is asleep.
What <i>do</i> you think of burglars, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re a bad lot, Nixie,&rdquo; said her papa,
&ldquo;a bad lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are there no good burglars, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Nixie,&rdquo; answered papa, &ldquo;I should say not.
As a rule you know,&mdash;&rdquo; and here he began to
smile, as people often smiled at Editha when she
asked questions&mdash;&ldquo;As a rule burglars are not distinguished
for moral perspicuity and blameless character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Editha did not understand what moral perspicuity
meant, and besides she was thinking again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lane was talking to me the other day,
about some poor children who had never been taught
anything; they had never had any French or music
lessons, and scarcely knew how to read, and she said
they had never had any advantages. Perhaps that
is the way with the burglars, papa,&mdash;perhaps they
have never had any advantages,&mdash;perhaps if they
had had advantages they mightn&rsquo;t have been burglars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lessons in French and music are very elevating
to the mind, my dear Nixie,&rdquo; papa began in his
laughing way, which was always a trial to Editha,
but suddenly he stopped, and looked at her rather
sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, Nixie?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Through the newspapers she found there were men who lived by
breaking into people&rsquo;s houses.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am seven,&rdquo; answered Editha, &ldquo;seven years,
going on eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Papa sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, little one,&rdquo; he said, holding out his
strong white hand to her.</p>
<p>She left her chair and went to him, and he put his
arms around her, and kissed her, and stroked her
long brown hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t puzzle your little brain too much,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;never mind about the burglars, Nixie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Editha, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking about
them a little, and it seems to me that there must be,
perhaps, one good burglar among all the bad ones,
and I can&rsquo;t help being rather sorry, even for the bad
ones. You see, they must have to be up all night,
and out in the rain sometimes, and they can&rsquo;t help
not having had advantages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was strange that the first thing she heard, when
she went up to her mamma&rsquo;s room, was something
about burglars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>She was very, very fond of her mamma, and very
proud of her. She even tried to take care of her in
her small way; she never disturbed her when she was
asleep, and she always helped her to dress, bringing
her things to her, buttoning her little shoes and
gloves, putting the perfume on her handkerchiefs,
and holding her wraps until she wanted them.</p>
<p>This morning, when she went into the dressing
room, she found the chamber-maid there before her,
and her dear little mamma looking very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah mem! if you please mem!&rdquo; the chambermaid
was saying, &ldquo;what a blessing it was they didn&rsquo;t
come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Janet?&rdquo; Editha asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The burglars, Miss, that broke into Number
Eighteen last night, and carried off all the silver,
and the missus&rsquo;s jewelry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If burglars ever do break in here,&rdquo; said mamma,
&ldquo;I hope none of us will hear them, though it would
almost break my heart to have my things taken. If
I should waken in the night, and find a burglar in
my room, I think it would kill me, and I know I
should scream, and then there is no knowing what
they might do. If ever you think there is a burglar
in the house, Nixie, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t scream
or make any noise. It would be better to have
one&rsquo;s things stolen, than to be killed by burglars for
screaming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p021.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="702" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Never mind about the burglars, Nixie.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>She was not a very wise little mamma, and often
said rather thoughtless things; but she was very
gentle and loving, and Editha was so fond of her
that she put her arms round her waist and said to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, dearest, I will never let any burglars
hurt you or frighten you if I can help it. I do believe
I could persuade them not to. I should think
even a burglar would listen to reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That made her mamma laugh, so that she forgot
all about the burglars and began to get her color
again, and it was not long before she was quite gay,
and was singing a song she had heard at the opera,
while Editha was helping her to dress.</p>
<p>But that very night Editha met a burglar.</p>
<p>Just before dinner, her papa came up from the city
in a great hurry. He dashed up to the front door
in a cab, and, jumping out, ran upstairs to mamma,
who was sitting in the drawing room, while Editha
read aloud to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am obliged to go to
Glasgow by the &lsquo;five&rsquo; train. I must throw a few
things into a portmanteau and go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Francis!&rdquo; said mamma. &ldquo;And just after
that burglary at the Norris&rsquo;s! I don&rsquo;t like to be
left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The servants are here,&rdquo; said papa, &ldquo;and Nixie
will take care of you; wont you, Nixie? Nixie is
interested in burglars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure Nixie could do more than the servants,&rdquo;
said mamma. &ldquo;All three of them sleep in
one room at the top of the house when you are
away, and even if they awakened they would only
scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixie wouldn&rsquo;t scream,&rdquo; said papa, laughing;
&ldquo;Nixie would do something heroic. I will leave
you in her hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was only joking, but Editha did not think of
what he said as a joke; she felt that her mamma
was really left in her care, and that it was a very
serious matter.</p>
<p>She thought about it so seriously that she hardly
talked at all at dinner, and was so quiet afterward
that her mamma said, &ldquo;Dear me, Nixie, what <i>are</i>
you thinking of? You look as solemn as a little
owl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking of you, mamma,&rdquo; the child answered.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/p025.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="500" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<span class="sc">The burglars, Miss, that broke into number eighteen last night.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>And then her mamma laughed and kissed her,
and said: &ldquo;Well, I must say I don&rsquo;t see why you
should look so grave about me. I didn&rsquo;t think I
was such a solemn subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last bed-time came, and the little girl went to
her mother&rsquo;s room, because she was to sleep there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I have you with me, Nixie,&rdquo; said
mamma, with a rather nervous little laugh. &ldquo;I am
sure I shouldn&rsquo;t like to sleep in this big room alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, after she was in bed, she soon fell asleep,
and lay looking so happy and sweet and comfortable
that Editha thought it was lovely to see her.</p>
<p>Editha did not go to sleep for a long time. She
thought of her papa trying to sleep on the train,
rushing through the dark night on its way to Scotland;
she thought of a new book she had just begun
to read; she thought of a child she had once
heard singing in the street; and when her eyes closed
at length, her mind had just gone back to the burglars
at Number Eighteen. She slept until midnight,
and then something wakened her. At first she did
not know what it was, but in a few minutes she
found that it was a queer little sound coming from
down-stairs,&mdash;a sound like a stealthy filing of iron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>She understood in a moment then, because she
had heard the chamber-maid say that the burglars
broke into Number Eighteen by filing through the
bars of the shutters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a burglar,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and he will
awaken mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had been older, and had known more of
the habits of burglars, she might have been more
frightened than she was. She did not think of herself
at all, however, but of her mother.</p>
<p>She began to reason the matter over as quickly as
possible, and she made up her mind that the burglar
must not be allowed to make a noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down and ask him to please be as quiet as
he can,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell him why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly, this was a queer thing to think of doing,
but I told you when I began my story that she was
a queer little girl.</p>
<p>She slipped out of bed so quietly that she scarcely
stirred the clothes, and then slipped just as quietly
out of the room and down the stairs.</p>
<p>The filing had ceased, but she heard a sound of
stealthy feet in the kitchen; and, though it must be
confessed her heart beat rather faster than usual,
she made her way to the kitchen and opened the
door.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic6">
<img src="images/p029.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am obliged to go to Glasgow.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Imagine the astonishment of that burglar when,
on hearing the door open, he turned round and
found himself looking at a slender little girl, in a
white frilled night-gown, and with bare feet,&mdash;a little
girl whose large brown eyes rested on him in a
by no means unfriendly way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be polite to him,&rdquo; Editha had said, as she
was coming down-stairs. &ldquo;I am sure he&rsquo;ll be more
obliging if I am very polite. Miss Lane says politeness
always wins its way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the first words she spoke were as polite as she
could make them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; she said, in a soft voice. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to hurt you; I came to ask a favor of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burglar was so amazed that he actually forgot
he was a burglar, and staggered back against the
wall. I think he thought at first that Editha was a little
ghost. &ldquo;You see I couldn&rsquo;t hurt you if I wanted
to,&rdquo; she went on, wishing to encourage him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
too little. I&rsquo;m only seven,&mdash;and a little over,&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m not going to scream, because that would waken
mamma, and that&rsquo;s just what I don&rsquo;t want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>That did encourage the burglar, but still he was
so astonished that he did not know what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed,&rdquo; he said in a whisper, &ldquo;if this
ain&rsquo;t a rummy go!&rdquo; which was extremely vulgar
language; but, unfortunately, he was one of those
burglars who, as Miss Lane said, &ldquo;had not had any
advantages,&rdquo; which is indeed the case with the majority
of the burglars of my acquaintance.</p>
<p>Then he began to laugh,&mdash;in a whisper also, if
one can be said to laugh in a whisper. He put his
hand over his mouth, and made no noise, but he
laughed so hard that he doubled up and rocked
himself to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rummiest go!&rdquo; he said, in his uneducated way.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; she haint agoin&rsquo; to &rsquo;urt me. Oh, my heye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was evidently very badly educated, indeed,
for he not only used singular words, but sounded
his h&rsquo;s all in the wrong places. Editha noticed this,
even in the midst of her surprise at his laughter.
She could not understand what he was laughing at.
Then it occurred to her that she might have made
a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; she said with great delicacy,
&ldquo;are you really a burglar?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="images/p033.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="703" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>He stopped laughing just long enough to answer
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; no, miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by no manner o&rsquo; means.
I&rsquo;m a dear friend o&rsquo; yer Par&rsquo;s, come to make a evenin&rsquo;
call, an&rsquo; not a wishin&rsquo; to trouble the servants, I stepped
in through the winder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Editha, looking very gravely at him;
&ldquo;I see you are joking with me, as papa does sometimes.
But what I wanted to say to you was this:
Papa has gone to Scotland, and all our servants are
women, and mamma would be so frightened if you
were to waken her, that I am sure it would make
her ill. And if you are going to burgle, would
you please burgle as quietly as you can, so that you
wont disturb her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burglar stopped laughing, and, staring at her,
once more uttered his vulgar exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blowed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be blown?&rsquo;&rdquo; asked
Editha. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t correct to say you&rsquo;ll be
blowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought he was going off into one of his unaccountable
fits of laughter again, but he did not;
he seemed to check himself with an effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;There haint no time to waste,&rdquo; she heard him
mutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;Mamma might wake and miss me. What are you
going to burgle first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go upstairs to yer mar,&rdquo; he said,
rather sulkily.</p>
<p>Editha thought deeply for a few seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to burgle anything,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Of course you know that, but if you have really
made up your mind to do it, I would like to show
you the things you&rsquo;d better take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, fer instance?&rdquo; said the burglar, with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take any of mamma&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; said
Editha, &ldquo;because they are all in her room, and you
would waken her, and besides, she said it would
break her heart; and don&rsquo;t take any of the things
papa is fond of. I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; turning rather
pale, &ldquo;you can take my things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind o&rsquo; things?&rdquo; asked the burglar.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic8">
<img src="images/p037.jpg" alt="" width="705" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">He laughed so hard, that he doubled up.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;My locket, and the little watch papa gave me,
and the necklace and bracelets my grandmamma left
me,&mdash;they are worth a great deal of money, and
they are very pretty, and I was to wear them when
I grew to be a young lady, but&mdash;you can take them.
And&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo; very slowly, and with a deep sigh,
&ldquo;there are&mdash;my books. I&rsquo;m very fond of them,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no books,&rdquo; said the burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; exclaimed she, &ldquo;Ah, thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the burglar, as if to himself, and
staring hard at her brightening face, &ldquo;I never see
no sich a start afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go upstairs and get the other things?&rdquo;
said Editha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You stay where you are&mdash;or
stay, come along o&rsquo; me inter the pantry, an&rsquo; sit down
while I&rsquo;m occypied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way into the pantry, and pushed her
down on a step, and then began to open the drawers
where the silver was kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its curious that you should know just where to
look for things, and that your key should fit, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; said Editha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s werry sing&rsquo;lar, indeed.
There&rsquo;s a good deal in bein&rsquo; eddicated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you educated?&rdquo; asked Editha with a look
of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did yer think I wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said the burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Editha, not wishing to offend him,
&ldquo;you see, you pronounce your words so very
strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a matter o&rsquo; taste,&rdquo; interrupted the burglar.
&ldquo;Oxford an&rsquo; Cambridge &rsquo;as different vocabillaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go to Oxford?&rdquo; asked Editha politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;nor yet to Cambridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he laughed again, and seemed to be quite
enjoying himself as he made some forks and spoons
up into a bundle. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ope there haint no plated
stuff &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Plate&rsquo;s wulgar, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;ope yer
parents haint wulgar, cos that&rsquo;d be settin&rsquo; yer a werry
bad example an&rsquo; sp&rsquo;ilin&rsquo; yer morals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure papa and mamma are not vulgar,&rdquo;
said Editha.</p>
<p>The burglar opened another drawer, and chuckled
again, and this suggested to Editha&rsquo;s mind another
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your business a good one?&rdquo; she suddenly inquired
of him.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic9">
<img src="images/p041.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="706" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious that you should know just where to look for things,&rdquo;
said Editha.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint as good as it ought to be, by no manner
o&rsquo; means,&rdquo; said the burglar. &ldquo;Every one haint as
hobligin&rsquo; as you, my little dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Editha. &ldquo;You know you obliged
me by not making a noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the burglar, &ldquo;as a rule, we don&rsquo;t
make a practice o&rsquo; makin&rsquo; no more noise than we can
help. It haint considered &rsquo;ealthy in the perfession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind leaving us a few forks and
spoons to eat with, if you please? I beg pardon
for interrupting you, but I&rsquo;m afraid we shall not have
any to use at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haint yer got no steel uns?&rdquo; inquired the
burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma wouldn&rsquo;t like to use steel ones, I&rsquo;m
sure,&rdquo; Editha answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you can
do: please leave out enough for mamma, and I can
use steel. I don&rsquo;t care about myself, much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man seemed to think a moment, and then he
was really so accommodating as to do as she asked,
and even went to the length of leaving out her own
little fork and knife and spoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you are very kind,&rdquo; said Editha, when she
saw him do this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a reward o&rsquo; merit, cos yer didn&rsquo;t squeal,&rdquo;
said the burglar.</p>
<p>He was so busy for the next few minutes that he
did not speak, though now and then he broke into
a low laugh, as if he was thinking of something very
funny, indeed. During the silence, Editha sat holding
her little feet in her night-gown, and watching
him very curiously. A great many new thoughts
came into her active brain, and at last she could not
help asking some more questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you really rather be a burglar than anything
else?&rdquo; she inquired, respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I&rsquo;d prefer to be
Lord Mayor, or a member o&rsquo; the &rsquo;Ouse o&rsquo; Lords, or
heven the Prince o&rsquo; Wales, honly for there bein&rsquo;
hobstacles in the way of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Editha; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t be the Prince
of Wales, you know. I meant wouldn&rsquo;t you rather be
in some other profession? My papa is an editor,&rdquo;
she added. &ldquo;How would you like to be an editor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the burglar, &ldquo;hif yer par ud change
with me, or hif he chanced to know hany heditor
with a roarin&rsquo; trade as ud be so hobligin&rsquo; as to &rsquo;and
it hover, hits wot I&rsquo;ve allers &rsquo;ad a leanin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic10">
<img src="images/p045.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="700" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">&ldquo;To think o&rsquo; a forgettin&rsquo; my card-case,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure papa would not like to be a burglar,&rdquo;
said Editha, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but perhaps he might
speak to his friends about you, if you would give me
your name and address, and if I were to tell him
how obliging you were, and if I told him you really
didn&rsquo;t like being a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burglar put his hand to his pocket and gave
a start of great surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think o&rsquo; me a forgettin&rsquo; my card-case,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; a leavin&rsquo; it on the pianner when I come
hout. I&rsquo;m sich a bloomin&rsquo; forgetful cove. I might
hev knowed I&rsquo;d hev wanted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said Editha; &ldquo;but if you told me
your name and your number, I think I could remember
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeared yer couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the burglar, regretfully,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll try yer. Lord Halgernon Hedward
Halbert de Pentonwille, YdePark. Can you
think o&rsquo; that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a lord?&rdquo; exclaimed Editha. &ldquo;Dear
me, how strange!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is sing&rsquo;lar,&rdquo; said the burglar, shaking his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hoften thought so myself. But not wishin&rsquo; to
detain a lady no longer than can be &rsquo;elped, s&rsquo;pose
we take a turn in the lib&rsquo;ery among yer respected
par&rsquo;s things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a noise,&rdquo; said Editha, as she led the
way.</p>
<p>But when they reached the library her loving little
heart failed her. All the things her father valued
most were there, and he would be sure to be so sorry
if one thing was missing when he returned. She
stood on the threshold a moment and looked about
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;please do me another
favor, wont you? Please let me slip quietly upstairs
and bring down my own things instead. They will
be so easy to carry away, and they are very valuable,
and&mdash;and I will make you a present of them if you
will not touch anything that belongs to papa. He
is so fond of his things and, besides that, he is so
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burglar gave a rather strange and disturbed
look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go an&rsquo; get yer gimcracks,&rdquo; he said in a somewhat
grumbling voice.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic11">
<img src="images/p049.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="711" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Editha came slowly down the staircase with her treasures.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Her treasures were in her own room, and her
bare feet made no sound as she crept slowly up the
staircase and then down again. But when she
handed the little box to the burglar her eyes were
wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa gave me the watch, and mamma gave me
the locket,&rdquo; she whispered, tremulously; &ldquo;and the
pearls were grandmamma&rsquo;s, and grandmamma is in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would not be easy to know what the burglar
thought; he looked queerer than ever. Perhaps he
was not quite so bad as some burglars, and felt rather
ashamed of taking her treasures from a little girl
who loved other people so much better than she
loved herself. But he did not touch any of papa&rsquo;s
belongings, and, indeed, did not remain much longer.
He grumbled a little when he looked into the
drawing-room, saying something to himself about
&ldquo;folks never &rsquo;avin&rsquo; no consideration for a cove, an&rsquo;
leavin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; portable &rsquo;andy, a expectin&rsquo; of him to
carry off seventy-five pound bronze clocks an&rsquo; marble
stattoos;&rdquo; but though Editha was sorry to see that
he appeared annoyed, she did not understand him.</p>
<p>After that, he returned to the pantry and helped
himself to some cold game pie, and seemed to enjoy
it, and then poured out a tumbler of wine, which
Editha thought a great deal to drink at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yer &rsquo;e&rsquo;lth, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; &rsquo;appy returns,
an&rsquo; many on &rsquo;em. May yer grow up a hornyment
to yer sect, an&rsquo; a comfort to yer respected mar an&rsquo;
par.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he threw his head very far back, and drank
the very last drop in the glass, which was vulgar, to
say the least of it.</p>
<p>Then he took up his bundles of silver and the
other articles he had appropriated, and seeing that
he was going away, Editha rose from the pantry step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going out through the window?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; he answered with a chuckle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a little &rsquo;abit I&rsquo;ve got into. I prefers &rsquo;em to doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-by,&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand
politely. &ldquo;And thank you, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt it only respectable to say that, even if he
had fallen into bad habits and become a burglar.</p>
<p>He shook hands with her in quite a friendly manner,
and even made a bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer welcome, my dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I must
hadd that if I ever see a queerer or better behaved
little kid, may I be blowed&mdash;or, as yer told me it
would be more correcter to say, I&rsquo;ll be blown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic12">

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">He threw his head very far back, which was vulgar.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Editha did not know he was joking; she thought
he was improving, and that if he had had advantages
he might have been a very nice man.</p>
<p>It was astonishing how neatly he slipped through
the window; he was gone in a second, and Editha
found herself standing alone in the dark, as he had
taken his lantern with him.</p>
<p>She groped her way out and up the stairs, and then,
for the first time, she began to feel cold and rather
weak and strange; it was more like being frightened
than any feeling she had had while the burglar was
in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if he had been a very bad burglar, he
might have killed me,&rdquo; she said to herself, trembling
a little. &ldquo;I am very glad he did not kill me, for&mdash;for
it would have hurt mamma so, and papa too,
when he came back, and they told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mamma wakened in the morning with a bright
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody hurt us, Nixie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are all
right, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma dear,&rdquo; said Editha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>She did not want to startle her just then, so she
said nothing more, and she even said nothing all
through the excitement that followed the discovery
of the robbery, and indeed, said nothing until her
papa came home, and then he wondered so at her
pale face, and petted her so tenderly, and thought it
so strange that nothing but her treasures had been
taken from upstairs, that she could keep her secret
no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she cried out all at once in a trembling
voice, &ldquo;I gave them to him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Nixie! You!&rdquo; exclaimed her papa, looking
alarmed. &ldquo;Kitty, the fright has made the poor
little thing ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; said Editha, her hands shaking, and
the tears rushing into her eyes, she did not know
why. &ldquo;I heard him, and&mdash;I knew mamma would
be so frightened,&mdash;and it came into my mind to ask
him&mdash;not to waken her,&mdash;and I crept down stairs&mdash;and
asked him;&mdash;and he was not at all unkind
though he laughed. And I stayed with him, and&mdash;and
told him I would give him all my things if he
would not touch yours nor mamma&rsquo;s. He&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t
such a bad burglar, papa,&mdash;and he told me he would
rather be something more respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic13">
<img src="images/p057.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="685" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<span class="sc">To think of her risking her dear little life to save me!</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>And she hid her face on her papa&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo; papa cried out. &ldquo;Oh, Kitty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her mamma flew to her and knelt down by
her, kissing her, and crying aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nixie! if he had hurt you,&mdash;if he had hurt
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew I was not going to scream, mamma,&rdquo;
said Editha. &ldquo;And he knew I was too little to hurt
him. I told him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scarcely understood why mamma cried so
much more at this, and why even papa&rsquo;s eyes were
wet as he held her close up to his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my fault, Francis,&rdquo; wept the poor little
mamma. &ldquo;I have left her too much to herself, and
I have not been a wise mother. Oh, to think of her
risking her dear little life just to save me from being
frightened, and to think of her giving up the things
she loves for our sakes. I will be a better mother
to her, after this, and take care of her more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>But I am happy to say that the watch and locket
and pearls were not altogether lost, and came back to
their gentle little owner in time. About six months
after, the burglar was caught, as burglars are apt to
be, and, after being tried and sentenced to transportation
to the penal settlements (which means that he
was to be sent away to be a prisoner in a far country),
a police officer came one day to see Editha&rsquo;s
papa, and he actually came from that burglar, who
was in jail and wanted to see Editha for a special
reason. Editha&rsquo;s papa took her to see him, and the
moment she entered his cell she knew him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, my lord?&rdquo; she said, in a gentle
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as lively as common, miss,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;in consekence o&rsquo; the confinement not bein&rsquo; good
fer my &rsquo;e&rsquo;lth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your chaff,&rdquo; said the police officer.
&ldquo;Say what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, strange to say, the burglar brought
forth from under his mattress a box, which he
handed to the little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One o&rsquo; my wisitors brought &rsquo;em in to me this
mornin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought yer might as well
hev &rsquo;em. I kep&rsquo; &rsquo;em partly &rsquo;cos it was more convenienter,
an&rsquo; partly &rsquo;cos I took a fancy to yer. I&rsquo;ve
seed a many curi&rsquo;s things, sir,&rdquo; he said to Editha&rsquo;s
papa, &ldquo;but never nothin&rsquo; as bloomin&rsquo; queer as that
little kid a-comin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; me she wont &rsquo;urt me,
nor yet wont scream, and please wont I burgle
quietly so as to not disturb her mar. It brought my
&rsquo;art in my mouth when first I see her, an&rsquo; then, lor&rsquo;,
how I larft. I almost made up my mind to give her
things back to her afore I left, but I didn&rsquo;t quite do
that&mdash;it was agin human natur&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic14">
<img src="images/p061.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="704" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">The burglar brought from under his mattress a box, which he
handed to the little girl.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>But they were in the box now, and Editha was so
glad to see them that she could scarcely speak for
a few seconds. Then she thanked the burglar politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
really very sorry you are to be sent so far away. I
am sure papa would have tried to help you if he
could, though he says he is afraid you would not do
for an editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burglar closed one eye and made a very singular
grimace at the police officer, who turned away
suddenly and did not look round until Editha had
bidden her acquaintance good-bye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>And even this was not quite all. A few weeks
later, a box was left for Editha by a very shabby,
queer-looking man, who quickly disappeared as soon
as he had given it to the servant at the door; and
in this box was a very large, old-fashioned silver
watch, almost as big as a turnip, and inside the lid
were scratched these words:</p>
<p class="center">To the little Kid,
<br />From &rsquo;er fr&rsquo;end and wel wisher,
<br />Lord halgernon hedward halbert
<br />de pentonwill, ide park.</p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
